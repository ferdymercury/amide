                                    The two data sets (FDG PET and microCT) and 1 ROI (bladder) are
                                    children of the study object (m2862). The remaining ROI's are
                                    children of the data sets.

                <para>In order to facilitate working with a large number of
                    objects simultaneously, AMIDE conceptually groups all objects
                    into a tree hierarchy, with the study object as the root of the
                    tree (see<xref linkend="studytree-fig"/>). Data set objects
                    will generally be primary branches off of the study object, while
                    ROI's can be branches off of the study object or off of
                    individual data sets. Why is this important? Because the
                    structure of the tree determines how movements are mapped within
                    the program. If a data set is moved relative to the rest of the
                    study, the ROI's that are branches from that data set object will
                    be correspondingly moved, so that they will maintain the correct
                    orientation and position with respect to the data set that is
                    their parent.
                </para>
            </sect3>

            <sect3>
                <title>Real World Units</title>

                <para>An important thing to realize when working with AMIDE is
                    that the program will try to abstract away the underlying digital
                    format of the data as much as possible. When you listen to
                    digital audio, the CD player automatically converts the series of
                    0's and 1's encoded on the compact disc into an analog format so
                    that you don't have to worry about the underlying digital format.
                    Similarly, AMIDE presents the digital data to you in analog form.
                    When ever possible, units are given in terms of real world units
                    (e.g. mm's, seconds), and most operations are not constrained by
                    the discrete nature of the underlying data. For example, data in
                    AMIDE is viewed in terms of "slices", not fixed image planes.
                    These slices can be taken from the data set at arbitary angles,
                    and can be of any thickness (they are not constrained to be
                    integer multiples of the underlying voxel size). You may be used
                    to looking at medical images in terms of voxels and integers, but
                    remember that the object or subject scanned is an item in the real
                    world, and AMIDE tries to recreate this "analog signal" for you.
                </para>

                <para>The only place the abstraction starts to break down is when
                    dealing with dynamic data sets. Einstein understood time to be a
                    "special" dimension, and AMIDE agrees. The reason for this, is
                    that trying to represent dynamic data as anything but separate
                    frames of data becomes overly complex from a computational
                    standpoint, primarily because dynamic data is generally not
                    equally spaced. While moving 1 voxel in the x, y, or z directions
                    will always move you a constant unit of measurement (say 0.4 mm)
                    in the appropriate direction, moving 1 voxel in the t direction
                    may move you 30 seconds or 30 minutes in time, depending on what
                    frame you're looking at. Because of this, AMIDE deals with
                    dynamic data in terms of frames, although it should always tell
                    you the time that those frames correspond to.

                    movements will be propogated to other objects in the study. For
                    instance, if a data set is rotated, all of its children will be
                    correspondingly rotated.

                    set is designated by being highlights, and when a function is
                    chosen that can logically apply to only one data set
                    (e.g. filtering), the active data set is the one chosen.

                <title>Orthogonal Views</title>

                <para>Most of the main window display consists of the orthogonal
                    views used for visually displaying the data sets being studied.
                    Data is usually presented as three orthogonal slices taken from
                    the data sets, but the user can choose to display fewer of these
                    views if desired by using the view selector (described below in
                    <xref linkend="view_selector"/>). The three views shown are the
                    transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes. Note that the views may
                    be incorrectly labeled for you. This could be because the data in
                    the file you imported was not in the order that AMIDE expected it
                    to be in. It could also be because you want to use the
                    transverse/coronal/sagittal terminology differently then the
                    program does (e.g. a coronal section of a rat brain is not the
                    same as a coronal section of a rat).
                </para>


                <para>Below the views are sliders for adjusting where in the data
                    set the slices are being taken from. The location can also be
                    changed by directly clicking on any of the canvases. The
                    appropriate mouse clicks are as follows

                    A log normalized histogram is shown to give an idea of the

                    and/or over multiple frames of data. As such, the effects are most
                    noticeable when the view thickness of the slices is increased
                    and/or several frames of data are being combined. For MPR, each
                    displayed pixel corresponds to the weighted average of the
                    underlying data. For MIP and MINIP, each displayed pixel

            <title>Importation of Data Sets</title>

            <para>AMIDE uses its own format (described below:<xref
                    linkend="xif-files"/>) for saving data between session. To get new
                data into AMIDE, it needs to be imported (located under the file
                menu). You can either let AMIDE try to guess the file format (which
                works for most data types) or tell AMIDE explicitly which format the
                file to be imported is suppose to be in. Importing of all data
                types except for raw data is done using Erik Nolf's

                <title>Raw Data Files</title>

                <para>AMIDE will generally attempt to load any file ending in
                    ".dat" or ".raw" as a raw data file. The user will be prompted
                    for the dimensions of the study, the offset of the data in the
                    file, and the data format of the data in the file. Both big
                    endian, little endian, and PDP endian files can be loaded (endian
                    refers to the order in which bytes are arranged in memory).
                </para>

                <para>The following data formats are supported: 8 bit signed or
                    unsigned integer, 16 bit signed or unsigned integer, 32 bit signed
                    or unsigned integer, 32 bit IEEE floating point, 64 bit IEEE

                <para>Static and dynamic ECAT 6.4 and 7.2 files are supported
                    through (X)MedCon. AMIDE will generally try to load any file
                    ending in ".img" as ECAT 6.4, and any file ending in ".v" as ECAT
                    7. Please note that ECAT 6.4 files are very difficult to
                    autodetect, so if the file does not end in .img, you will probably
                    have to tell AMIDE explicitly to import the file as ECAT
                    6.4.
                </para>

                <para>Although not compiled in by default, AMIDE can be configured
                    to use the z_matrix_7/libecat library for handling ECAT files

                <para>DICOM 3.0 is supported through (X)MedCon, which actually uses
                    a slightly modified version of Tony Voet's VT-DICOM library. The
                    level of support for DICOM 3.0 is entirely determined by
                    (X)MedCon/VT-DICOM.
                </para>

                <para>DICOM data is often distributed as a series of single slice
                    data files. To read these into AMIDE as a single data set, you
                    will need to stack these slices into a single, volumetric file.

                    Please note that you will need to tell AMIDE to open the header file

            <title>XIF Files</title>

            <para>AMIDE saves studies in an extensible XML based format called
                XIF (Xml Image Format). This format can be stored as either a
                single file (flat file format XIF) or as a XIF directory. The flat
                file format is the default, and simplifies file moving and handling.
            </para>

            <para>The directory format on the other hand allows easy access to the raw
                study data external to the AMIDE program, and will be of interest to
                developers. The directory format can be utilized via the "Save as
                XIF Directory" and "Open XIF Directory" menu items under the File
                menu.
            </para>

            <para>In any case, these files or directories will
                characteristically end with ".xif", and are treated identically
                within the AMIDE program.

                <para>From the main window, select "File->Open", and a file
                    selection widget will open up. Select an XIF filename in the
                    right column, and then hit the "OK" button (or double click on the
                    filename).

            </sect3>

            <sect3>
                <title>Saving Studies</title>

                <para>To save a study, from the study window select "File->Save As"
                    and a file selection dialog will appear. Look at the "selection:"
                    line near the bottom of the window, if this is the desired XIF
                    filename, hit "OK" and the file will be saved. If this is not the
                    desired XIF filename, select or enter in the correct XIF study,
                    and hit the "OK" button.
                </para>

                <para>Note that the original data set files are no longer needed by
                    AMIDE, as all the information AMIDE needs is saved inside the .XIF
                    file. You should however still archive the original data files,
                    as AMIDE only reads in and stores the information from the header
                    that it needs (which is generally not all the information enclosed
                    within the header).

                <title>XIF Directory Format</title>

                <para>Although admittedly annoying from a data transfer standpoint,
                    using a directory structure for saving study information has the
                    decisive advantage of making the saved information easily
                    accessible using standard command-line utilities and text-based
                    tools.
                </para>

                <para>Each XIF directory contains a file called "study_*.xml" which
                    contains the basic study parameters. Additional files can also be
                    found in the XIF directory, such as ROI_*.xml files which contain
                    ROI's, and data-set_*.xml files and their corresponding
                    data-set_*_raw-data files, which contain the image data set
                    parameters and the raw data respectively. The raw data file
                    format is arbitrary (double/float/int, 64/32/16/8 bit, little or
                    big endian, per plane/per frame/single scale factor), and is
                    determined by the format of the originally imported data.

            <sect3>
                <title>XIF Flat File Format</title>

                <para>The flat file format is basically a concatenation of the
                    information enclosed within the directory format. It is not meant
                    to be editable or developer friendly. Instead, it allows easy
                    management of studies for casual users. If you wish to access the
                    information in a XIF flat file external to AMIDE, you'll be much
                    better off resaving the data as in XIF directory format.
                </para>

                <para>The format is as follows: The first 64 bytes of the file
                    contain a magic string for format identification. The next 16 bytes
                    contain 2 64bit unsigned little endian integers, the first one being
                    the location of the study xml data within the file, and the second
                    integer being the size of this xml data. Within the study xml data,
                    is encased the information as to where in the file the children's
                    xml data is. And within the children's xml data, is enclosed the
                    location information of the raw data and subchildren.

                        respect to the transverse, coronal, and sagittal views. This is
                        easily done using the shift-2 mouse combination, but
                        can also be done from the data set modification dialog.

                            (DOB), conversion factor, and the interpolation type to use
                            for this data set (described at<xref linkend="interpolation"
                        />). The conversion factor is a parameter that is multiplied
                            to the data set before it is used for viewing or quantitation.
                            Since the data set is in ECAT/MAP/abitrary scale units, the
                            conversion factor can be used in order to analyze the data set
                            in another type of reference unit (e.g. Percent Injected Dose
                            [%ID]). There is also a built in calculator, where parameters
                            such as subject weight and injected dose can be entered, and
                            the conversion factor will be generated. Note that 1 cc is
                            assumed to equal 1 g when generating the %ID/g and SUV.

                            And the sagittal dial will spin the data set in the sagittal
                            plane (i.e. rotate on the x-axis). The "reset to default"
                            button allows the data set to be rotated back to the default

            <title>Drawing ROI's</title>

            <para>
                To draw an ROI, you first need to create a new ROI. You can add a
                new ROI to either the study, or a particular data set. To add an
                ROI to the study, you can either select the ROI desired under the
                "Edit->add ROI:" menu item, or right click on the blank area of
                the study tree. To add an ROI to a data set, shift-right click on
                the data set that you'd like to add the ROI to. In both cases, a
                dialog box will pop-up for you to enter in the new ROI's name.
            </para>

            <para>
                When first added, the new (undrawn) ROI will be selected in the
                study tree. When an undrawn ROI is selected in the study tree,
                the program will use the next mouse input on any of the displayed
                views to begin the process of drawing this ROI.
            </para>

            <para>
                For ellipsoid, elliptic cylinder, and box ROI's, a click with the
                left button will begin an edge-to-edge drawing, while a click with
                the middle button will begin a center-out drawing. The x and y
                dimensions of the ROI are determined by this process. The z
                dimension (thickness) of the ROI can be specified by the pop-up
                dialog that will appear on the completion of the mouse movement.
            </para>

            <para>
                For isocontour's, the value of the data set at the clicked upon
                location will be used to derive the isocontour.
            </para>

            <para>
                For freehand's, the point on the screen that is clicked upon will

            <para>
                After an ROI is drawn, it can be further manipulated to adjust its
                size, placement, and orientation. You can directly manipulate the
                ROI by clicking on it in any of the viewing windows. Mouse button
                1 is used to shift ROIs. Mouse button 2 is used for zooming
                ellipsoid, elliptic cylinder and box ROI, and is used for entering
                drawing mode for isocontour and freehand ROI's. Mouse button 3 is
                used to rotate ellipsoid, elliptic cylinder, and box ROIs, and for
                redefining the isocontour value for isocontour ROI's.
            </para>

            <para>For isocontour and freehand ROI's, drawing mode can be
                entered by using thie middle mouse button (button 2). Once
                entered, points can be added or removed from the ROI by using the
                left (button 1) or right (button 3) mouse buttons, respectively.
                Holding down the shift key while using these buttons increases
                the size of the action. The middle button (button 2) allows the
                user to leave drawing mode.
            </para>

            <para>
                You can also edit the ROI size/placement/orientation/name etc. by
                clicking on mouse button 3 while over the ROI's name in the study
                item list. This brings up the ROI modification dialog (described
                at<xref linkend="roi-dialog"/>).

                        Currently, AMIDE generates variance and standard deviation values
                        that may occasionally be of interest to imaging physicists. It
                        is very important to remember, that these numbers represent the

                        <emphasis>Short story:</emphasis>
                        The calculated volume shown
                        by the ROI statistics dialog is correct. Use this value as the
                        volume of the ROI, not the value you might calculate by hand based
                        on the ROI's dimensions.

                        <emphasis>Long story:</emphasis>
                        AMIDE calculates ROI's by
                        translating the ROI's dimensions into the data set's coordinate
                        space. It then computes statistics for all the data set voxels
                        that are in the ROI. For voxels that lie on the edge of the ROI,
                        AMIDE will subdivide the voxel into a finite number of subvoxels,
                        and calculate over the subvoxels. This approach yields correct
                        statistics, but it is important to realize that the computed ROI
                        is a discrete representation of the specified analytical ROI. So
                        while the true volume of an ellipse is pi*r1*r2*r3, the computed
                        volume of the ellipse in AMIDE will depend on the number of voxels
                        and subvoxels that were determined to lie within the ellipse,
                        which in turn can depend on the orientation of the ROI with
                        respect to the data set in question. Since the computed volume
                        given by AMIDE represents the volume in the data set that was used
                        for the ROI calculation, you will want to use that value (not the
                        real ellipse value).

                    <para>AMIDE doesn't present the "total" value in the ROI, as it
                        doesn't necessarily know what the units of the underlying data are.
                        If you're using PET or SPECT data, your voxel values are most
                        likely proportional to activity/volume/time. To calculate the
                        total in your ROI, you should multiple the mean value of the ROI
                        times the ROI volume and the frame duration. If you're using CT
                        data, your values are probably proportional to density, so to
                        calculate the total you would multiple the mean ROI value by the
                        ROI volume.

            here diverges from the traditional nuclear medicine use of the word,
            in which study generally connotates a single scan (or occasionally
            multiple but highly coupled scans) done on a single patient. A study
            in AMIDE is often used to group an entire experiment (several
            patients, several animals, whatever) into a single file. The study
            object itself is used mostly for storing parameters that effect all
            other objects stored in the study.

        <title>Viewing Series of Slices</title>
        <para>
            Instead of looking at three orthogonal slices through the data set,
            a series of slices (all of the same orientation) can also be
            examined. Select: "View->Series", and a dialog box will come up
            allowing you to pick which objects you'd like to display on the
            series viewer, along with if you'd like to display the slices over
            space, time, or gates. The thickness of the slices are determined
            at the time the series window is brought up. A slider appears on
            the top of the window which allows moving through the data set.
            Note that since slices are cached in memory after being displayed,
            already displayed slices do not need to be regenerated from the
            data set and reviewing these slices is significantly faster.

        <title>Rendering Data</title>

        <para>Rendering in AMIDE is accomplished using the <ulink type="http"
                                                                  url="https://graphics.stanford.edu/software/volpack/">
            Volpack volume
            rendering library</ulink>. This software library is both portable,
            and provides for true volume rendering (as opposed to the surface
            rendering used by many other libraries and hardware
            accelerators).
        </para>

        <para>To start a rendering window, select the "View->Rendering" menu
            item. A small dialog window will pop-up allowing you to select
            which objects you'd like rendered, along with some additional
            options. The first "Set values greater than max threshold to zero"
            allows you to strip high level voxels out of the rendering process.
            In general you won't want this, but it might be useful if you have
            high valued areas in your data set that obscures what you'd like to
            see. The second option "Accelerate Rendering" tells VolPack to use
            a faster method for doing the volume rendering. You will in general
            want to use this option, as it causes a significance performance
            enhancement (around 10 fold). It does, however, require around 3
            fold as much rendering as the non-accelerated option, so if you're
            running out of memory, you'll want to try to rendering without the
            acceleration. The third option "Initial opacity functions only
            density dependent" sets things such that the initial gradient
            opacity function does not contribute to the rendering. This is
            useful for data sets (e.g. PET) where one is more interested in
            having an accurate view of the data, rather than a view where
            gradients in the data set are highlighted.
        </para>

        <para>After hitting "Execute" the program will reslice the data sets
            and ROI's into a data structure that the volpack library can handle,
            and then perform some initial renderin gcalculations. For data
            sets, the
            <link linkend="interpolation">interpolation type</link>
            specified for the data set will be used. This whole process will
            take some time, so be patient. Please also note that, when
            converting the data set, the data is scaled between the current
            minimum and maximum threshold, with all data above the current
            maximum threshold set to the maximum threshold value (or zero, if
            specified), and all data below the current minimum threshold set to
            the minimum threshold value. This scaling can be relative to the
            data set's "Global" maximum and minimum, to the "Per Frame" maximum
            and minimum, or can be from maximum and minimum values "Interpolated
            Between Frames". "Per slice" scaling does not make sense in the
            context of volume rendering, and is interpreted as "Global"
            scaling.

        <para>When all this is completed, the rendering window should pop-up.

                    appropriately labeled with the axis around which the rendering
                    will be spun if they are changed. Additionally you should
                    notice a dial widget (labeled 'z'). The dial is for rotating on
                    the z axis (which comes out of the plane of the display). Note

                                    This is the most confusing part of rendering, so hang on here.
                                    The classification functions are used to map between the value
                                    in each voxel and how much that voxel should be represented in
                                    the final rendered image. On the x axis is the possible
                                    values of the different voxels. On the y-axis is the opacity
                                    that will be given a voxel based on its value.

                                <para>
                                    Both classification functions have several buttons on the
                                    right side of their graphs. The top button allows the
                                    classification function to be drawn as a spline. The second
                                    button allows the classification function to be drawn as a
                                    series of straight lines. Finally, the last button resets
                                    the classification function to a straight line.

                                            function tells you how opaque each voxel will be based on
                                            its current value. In a sense, this is analogous to an
                                            x-ray, where the amount of the x-rays that are absorbed in
                                            a structure is related to the density of that structure.

                                            Instead of relating the density of a voxel to its opacity,
                                            this function relates the gradient of a voxel (how much
                                            the value changes between this voxel and its neighbors)
                                            to its opacity. This has the effect of giving added
                                            weight to surfaces.

                        slightly different angles. When viewed correctly, these two
                        images can be interpreted by the viewer's eyes as a single image

                    with values either close to zero or close to unity can be counted
                    as completely translucent or completely opaque, respectively. The

                    quality setting uses this approximation big-time.

                        greater sensation of depth in the image pair. A Reasonable value
                        for this parameter is between 2 and 5 degrees. Note that this
                        parameter will be saved between different sessions of the

                    <para>Ideally, this should be (roughly) the distance between the
                        two rendered images, and corresponds to the distance between the
                        user's eyes. It is impossible for a person to resolve a
                        stereoscopic pair if the images are farther apart then the
                        person's eyes, since human eyes cannot move independently. While
                        this parameter is specified in millimeters, the actually distance
                        between the pair of images that gets displayed on the monitor
                        depends on the setup of the computer. If the monitor information

                    period, which is useful for dynamic data sets.

                <para>Note that every time a frame boundary in the data set is
                    passed over, the rendering process must slice and load in a new
                    frame of data. This makes creating a rendered movie over time
                    significantly slower than a movie with just rotations.
                </para>

                <para>Picking "over time" will allow entry of a start and end time
                    for which the data from the data sets should be drawn. With the
                    "over time" option, each second is given equal waiting in terms of
                    how many images from that time period are generated for the output

                    (note that this really only makes sense with a single data set).
                    The advantage of "over frames", is that each frame is weighted
                    equally in terms of how many images are generated for the output
                    movie, so for data sets were the dynamics of interest correspond
                    closely to the dynamics of the data set framing sequence, "over

                <para>The "over frames smoothed" option is almost the same as
                    "over frames", except that data will be interpolated between
                    frames. This makes for a smoother movie (no jumps) but takes much
                    longer as nearly every movie frame has to be reloaded.

                <para>A rigid body alignment can be performed utilizing mutual
                    information between two data sets. This algorithm works by
                    taking orthogonal slices from one data set (transverse, coronal, and
                    sagittal) and computing a transform to best allow matching of these

                            the alignment wizard to recognize two fiducial markers as a
                            pair, they must have exactly the same name. So if you have a
                            marker labeled "1" under the first data set, you will need
                            another marker, also labeled "1", under the second data set.

                    Fiducial markers can be added to any of the data sets in the study
                    in a variety of ways. For the currently active data set, hitting
                    the "Edit->Add fiducial mark" menu item will drop a fiducial maker
                    at the currently viewed location. Fiducial marks can be added for
                    the active data set directly from the views by pressing ctrl-right
                    mouse button, which will drop a fiducial marker at the point that
                    the mouse is currently at. Finally, fiducial markers can be added
                    to non-active data sets by pressing ctrl-right mouse button while
                    hovering over a data set's name in the study list.

            <para>The left and right limits of the gaussian fit can be altered
                by clicking on the profile with the left and right mouse buttons,
                respectively. The x value used for initializing the gaussian fit can
                be picked by clicking on the profile with the middle mouse button.

            <para>Note that the line profile is extracted from the currently
                viewed image, not the underlying raw data itself. This means things
                like the current interpolation and FOV will effect the line profile
                that's generated, and as such may effect the FWHM that's fitted.
